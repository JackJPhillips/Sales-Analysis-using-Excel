# Sales Dataset Analysis in Excel

Here is my Sales Dataset Analysis project. This Excel-based analysis showcases a range of essential spreadsheet skills used by me to explore, summarize, and visualize sales data effectively.

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills Demonstrated
### 1.  Cell Referencing
- Both relative and absolute referencing.

### 2. Functions & Formulas
- Basic Aggregates such as SUM, AVERAGE for total and mean calculations.
- Conditional Aggregates like SUMIF, SUMIFS for targeted summary based on criteria, AVERAGEIF, AVERAGEIFS for conditional averages.
- User-Defined Formulas using custom logic to pull specific data using things like nested functions and named ranges.

### 3. Conditional Formatting:
- Highlighting trends, outliers, and performance thresholds visually.

### 4. Pivot Tables & Charts

- Using Pivot Tables to summarized sales by region, product, and time period.
- Pivot Charts can visualize key metrics for quick and easy insights.
- Slicers were also used to enabled interactive filtering for dynamic data exploration.

## üìÅ Dataset Overview
### The dataset includes:
- Sales transactions
- Customer Information
- Product categories

### From this data I then calculated commision for a specified year:

### The total sales for each category before then calculating the average sales:

### Finally adding in the difference between male and female customers:

### I then created a pivot table, still split by category only now looking at the differences across generations:

### Adding slicers was next:

### Before adding in a pivot chart to display a visual for the results found that could be interacted with by the slicers:

## üéØ Objective
The objective of these exercises were to provide actionable insights into sales performance, identify growth opportunities, and support decision-making through Excel-based analysis while increasing my knowledge and skill with excel as a tool for data analysis.
